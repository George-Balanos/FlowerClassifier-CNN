# FlowerClassifier-CNN
This project represents my first approach to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and neural networks in general. I developed FlowerClassifier-CNN as a beginner's exploration into deep learning, focusing on classifying flower species through image recognition.

## Features
- **Flower Recognition**: Classifies uploaded flower images into species categories.
- **Flask Web Application**: A simple Flask server enables an interactive, user-friendly web interface for image uploads.

### Flower Classes
The FlowerClassifier-CNN is trained to recognize the following flower species:
- **Lilly**
- **Lotus**
- **Orchid**
- **Sunflower**
- **Tulip**
